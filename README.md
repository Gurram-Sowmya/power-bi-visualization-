**Realmart Supermarket Expansion Analysis** <br>
This project aims to support Realmart's plan to open a new supermarket branch by analyzing sales data from existing branches. Using data on customer demographics, product sales, financial metrics, and more, I conducted a comprehensive analysis to identify key trends and patterns. The insights derived from this analysis will guide strategic decision-making for the new branch, ensuring optimized performance and growth. The project includes data cleaning, descriptive analysis, sales and financial performance evaluation, customer insights, and the creation of interactive dashboards to visualize findings and recommendations.
